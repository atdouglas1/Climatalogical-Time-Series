## Forecasting Temperature and Hurricane Paths using Time Series
In EPICA_C TEMP, I compare RNN/LSTM Encoder-Decoder networks and linear regression models' predictions of future temperatures in 10,000-year increments using historical temperature data from the EPICA C ice core sample in Antarctica. In HURRICANE TRAJECTORIES, I compare these models' predictions of North Atlantic Basin hurricane trajectories in 24-hour increments.

## It includes:
- Custom Python functions and classes
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
